## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Planning & Architecture (via Miro)
- Data Flow Diagram: Source → ETL → Snowflake DB → Excel/BI Tool
- Key insights identified: product/category performance, time-based trends, revenue analysis
- Calculations outlined:
  - `total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty`
  - Grouping by 30-minute (or 1-hour) intervals

### 2. Data Processing in Snowflake
- Converted Excel data to CSV
- Handled formatting (e.g., commas in unit prices)
- Calculated:
  - `transaction_time_bucket`
  - `total_amount`
- Grouped data by product types, categories, time buckets

### 3. Data Analysis in Excel
- Created dashboards with:
  - Total revenue by product type
  - Peak time intervals
  - Quantity sold by category
  - Best-performing products

### 4. Presentation to the CEO
- Delivered in PowerPoint with clear visuals
- Key recommendations:
  - Schedule marketing during low-sales periods
  - Increase stock for bestsellers
  - Promote underperforming items
  - Implement loyalty programs
  - Automate daily sales reporting
